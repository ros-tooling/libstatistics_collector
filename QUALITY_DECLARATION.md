## Documentation [3]

### Feature Documentation [3.i]

`libstatistics_collector` has a [feature list](https://github.com/ros-tooling/libstatistics_collector/blob/master/README.md) and each item in the list links to the corresponding feature documentation. There is documentation for all of the features, and new features require documentation before being added.

### Public API Documentation [3.ii]

The API documentation is not publicly available yet.

### License [3.iii]

The license for `libstatistics_collector` is Apache 2.0, and a summary is in each source file, the type is declared in the [`package.xml`](./package.xml) manifest file, and a full copy of the license is in the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file.

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has a license statement. [Here](https://ci.ros2.org/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/libstatistics_collector/) can be found a list with the latest results of the various linters being run on the package.

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has at least one copyright statement. Latest linter result report can be seen [here](http://build.ros2.org/view/Epr/job/Epr__libstatistics_collector__ubuntu_bionic_amd64/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/libstatistics_collector/copyright/).

## Testing [4]

### Feature Testing [4.i]

Each feature in `libstatistics_collector` has corresponding tests which simulate typical usage, and they are located in the [`test`](https://github.com/ros2/libstatistics_collector/tree/master/test) directory.
New features are required to have tests before being added.

Currently nightly test results can be seen here:

* [linux-aarch64_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux-aarch64_release/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/libstatistics_collector/)
* [linux_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/libstatistics_collector/)
* [mac_osx_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_osx_release/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/libstatistics_collector/)
* [windows_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_win_rel/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/libstatistics_collector/)

### Public API Testing [4.ii]

Each part of the public API has tests, and new additions or changes to the public API require tests before being added.
The tests aim to cover both typical usage and corner cases, but are quantified by contributing to code coverage.

### Coverage [4.iii]

`libstatistics_collector` follows the recommendations for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#code-coverage), and opts to use line coverage instead of branch coverage.

This includes:

- tracking and reporting line coverage statistics
- achieving and maintaining a reasonable branch line coverage (90-100%)
- no lines are manually skipped in coverage calculations

Changes are required to make a best effort to keep or increase coverage before being accepted, but decreases are allowed if properly justified and accepted by reviewers.

Each time that a new PR is created [codecov](https://codecov.io/) will create diagram to show the current status of the test coverage and how this PR will affect the coverage of the package. Latest codecov result report can be seen [here](https://codecov.io/gh/ros-tooling/libstatistics_collector).

### Performance [4.iv]

The performance tests of this package are located in the [test/benchmark directory](https://github.com/ros-tooling/libstatistics_collector/tree/master/test/benchmark). The most recent test results can be found [here](http://build.ros2.org/view/Rci/job/Rci__benchmark_ubuntu_focal_amd64/BenchmarkTable/).

### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]

`libstatistics_collector` uses and passes all the ROS2 standard linters and static analysis tools for a C++ package as described in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#linters-and-static-analysis). Passing implies there are no linter/static errors when testing against CI of supported platforms.

Currently nightly test results can be seen here:
* [linux-aarch64_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux-aarch64_release/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/libstatistics_collector/)
