## Description

REMOVE ME: A short description of this large feature / feature set. An epic should still be well scoped and have a clear concept of where "finished" is.

## Documents

REMOVE ME: Link or include any designs that inform this Epic's completion criteria.

## Completion Criteria

REMOVE ME: Instead of creating a list here, start creating issues under this epic, this will be the TO-DO list for this Epic. When all children are done, this Epic is done. That list may fluctuate as requirements are discovered/negotiated.
